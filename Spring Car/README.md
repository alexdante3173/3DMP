# Pull Back Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car
## _The Ultimate Spring Car_


Pull Back Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car is a rolling
chassis having 3 modes of operation: wind, power
and coast.

- This vehicle uses a floating pinion gear designed to wind
the spring when the vehicle is rapidly rolled backwards.
This is the _wind mode_.
- Once the spring is wound, releasing the vehicle propels it
forward until the spring is depleted of its stored energy. 
This is the _power mode_.
- âœ¨Finally, after the spring is depleted, a second floating 
pinion gear disengages the spring motor from the rear axle
allowing the vehicle to coast. 
This is the _coast mode_.
## Designing the Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car
### I. The Spring Motor
 
 The spring motor consists of the following: knob, spring, pawl and gear pawl. The knob is used to wind the spring and engage the ratchet mechansim. The latter consists of the pawl and pawl gear. By rotating the knob clockwise the pawl will also move clockwise inside the gear pawl. Becase of the way the gear pawl was designed the pawl can only execute a clockwise motion inside the gear pawl. Once the spring is fully wound, the force deplating the spring will be strong enough to rotate, thanks to the pawl, the gear pawl counterclockwise. This essentially what powers up the Spring Car. If you want to find out more about how a ratchet mechansim works, you can check out [THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpVPG2fZrHE). If you feel like things get complicated, you are no wrong.Here is a cheesy quote to keep you going:


> In the end everyhting will be okay.
> If it's not okay, it's not yet the end.

### II. The Gear Train and Wheels   

The Gear Train consists of three gears: "Gear, Compound", "Gear, Floating Pinion" and "Gear, Axle". The motion produced by the motor will first rotate the Gear, Compound, which will move the Gear, Floating Pinion, which will move the Gear, Axle. The latter induces a circular motion on Axle 1, subsequently on the Rear Wheels. The Spring Motor will deliver enough torque to the rear wheels to overcome stationary forces and make the Spring Car
move forward.

## Files 

Inside the Spring Car folder you have every component of the car saved as an .stl file, the whole car saved as an .f3d file and the sliced components saved as .gcode files.

## Software

The software I used to design and render the Spring Car is Fusion360 and PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 for slicing.
