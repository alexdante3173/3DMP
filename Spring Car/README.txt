Pull Back Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car is a rolling
chassis having 3 modes of operation: wind, power
and coast.

This vehicle uses a floating pinion gear designed to wind
the spring when the vehicle is rapidly rolled backwards.
This is the wind mode.

Once the spring is wound, releasing the vehicle propels it
forward until the spring is depleted of its stored energy. 
This is the power mode.

Finally, after the spring is depleted, a second floating 
pinion gear disengages the spring motor from the rear axle
allowing the vehicle to coast. 
This is the coast mode.

  I. How I designed the Spring Motor
  
 The spring motor consists of the following: knob, spring, pawl and gear pawl. The knob is used to wind the spring and engage the ratchet mechansim. 
 The latter consists of the pawl and pawl gear. By rotating the knob clockwise the pawl will also move clockwise inside the gear pawl. Becase of the
 way the gear pawl was designed the pawl can only execute a clockwise motion inside the gear pawl. Once the sprig is fully wound, the force deplating 
 the spring will be strong enough to rotate, thanks to the pawl, the gear pawl counterclockwise. If you want to find out more about how a ratchet 
 mechansim works, you can check out THIS LINK
