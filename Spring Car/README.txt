Pull Back Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car Chassis is a rolling
chassis having 3 modes of operation: wind, power
and coast.

This vehicle uses a floating pinion gear designed to wind
the spring when the vehicle is rapidly rolled backwards.
This is the wind mode.

Once the spring is wound, releasing the vehicle propels it
forward until the spring is depleted of its stored energy. 
This is the power mode.

Finally, after the spring is depleted, a second floating 
pinion gear disengages the spring motor from the rear axle
allowing the vehicle to coast. 
This is the coast mode.
