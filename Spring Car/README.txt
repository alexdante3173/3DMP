Pull Back Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car is a rolling
chassis having 3 modes of operation: wind, power
and coast.

This vehicle uses a floating pinion gear designed to wind
the spring when the vehicle is rapidly rolled backwards.
This is the wind mode.

Once the spring is wound, releasing the vehicle propels it
forward until the spring is depleted of its stored energy. 
This is the power mode.

Finally, after the spring is depleted, a second floating 
pinion gear disengages the spring motor from the rear axle
allowing the vehicle to coast. 
This is the coast mode.

                            How I designed the Tri-Mode Spring Motor Car:

  I. The Spring Motor
  
 The spring motor consists of the following: knob, spring, pawl and gear pawl. The knob is used to wind the spring and engage the ratchet mechansim. 
 The latter consists of the pawl and pawl gear. By rotating the knob clockwise the pawl will also move clockwise inside the gear pawl. Becase of the
 way the gear pawl was designed the pawl can only execute a clockwise motion inside the gear pawl. Once the spring is fully wound, the force deplating 
 the spring will be strong enough to rotate, thanks to the pawl, the gear pawl counterclockwise. This essentially what powers up the Spring Car.

 II. The Gear Train and Wheels
 
The Gear Train consists of three gears: "Gear, Compound", "Gear, Floating Pinion" and "Gear, Axle". The motion produced by the motor will first
rotate the Gear, Compound, which will move the Gear, Floating Pinion, which will move the Gear, Axle. The latter induces a circular motion on Axle 1,
subsequently on the Rear Wheels. The Spring Motor will deliver enough torque to the rear wheels to overcome stationary forces and make the Spring Car
move forward.

 The software I used to designe and render the Spring Car is Fusion360 and PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 for slicing.
 This design was made by Alexandra Dinu.
