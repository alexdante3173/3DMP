# 3DMP
This repository contains all the projects I designed for the 3D Modeling And Printing Course.

## Homework 1
This folder contains the .f3d file of an extrued Mario. The purpose of this first project was to learn some of the basics tools necessary for 3D Modeling. Here in particular we focused on how to start a project using a canvas as support (how to import, scale it, etc.), create a sketch using the canvas and extrude the sketch. 
## Homework 2

This folder contains four .f3d files and their corresponding .svg files. Each .f3d file is an "object" I created strating from a given sketch. The purpose of this second homework was to learn how to use parametric modeling to create a 3D model based on a technical drawing. 

## Homework 3

This project was more elaborate compared to the previous ones. The task was to design all six chess pieces (king, queen, bishop, knight, rook, pawn) starting from an .svg file. Inside the folder there is an .f3d of every chess piece and an .f3d file with the chess peices on a chess board. There is an .svg and a .gcode file for every piece. 

## Homework 4

This project contains two 3D designs: Leonardo da Vinci's Spatial Slider-Crank and Scotch Yoke mechanism. Here we focused on creating useful sketches, adding as built joints, motion links and creating motion studies.

## Spring Car

This final project is a design of a Pull Back Tri-Mode Spring Car, which is a rolling chassis having 3 modes of operation: wind, power and coast. For in depth details, you can check out the README file inside the folder.

### Software

The software I used for designing and rendering all my projects was Fusion360 and for the slicing part I used PrusaSlicer.

### Creator

All designs were made by Alexandra Dinu.
